    "As programs and functions become more complex following an *incremental development* process is an effective way to avoid long tedious debugging sessions.  When doing *incremental development* you make only small changes or add only a little bit of code at a time to a working program.  The goal is to keep the program working at all times. If the program stops working and you have only added a little bit of code or made a small change it will *typically* be fairly easy to identify where the problem is.  If you have made tons of changes or added a lot of code, finding a bug will be much more difficult.\n",

    "The examples below walk through illustrate an *incremental development* process for one small example.  The steps shown here will be:\n",

    "- Sketch the program and identify functions\n",
    "- Write a *stub* for the function and call it with *dummy arguments*\n",
    "- Expand and hand test the function\n",

    "  - Iterate\n",
    "- Produce *automated tests* for the function\n",

What is important is that you know what the steps are so that when you run into trouble you have strategies for figuring out what is going on and how to fix it."
