    "[Beat That](https://kidshopeusa.org/beat-that-math-dice-game/) is kids game played with two six-sided die.  A player rolls the two die and then orders the numbers to make the largest number possible.  For example, with a roll of 3 and 5 the die could be ordered as 35 or as 53, so they would be ordered as 53 to make the larger number.  Similarly a roll of 2 and 6 would be ordered to make 62. Two players then take turns rolling for some number of turns. A total is kept for each player and the player with the highest total across all of the turns is the winner.\n",
